**PixelmonESP** can show traces, boxes, names, widgets (nearby GOOD entities), info (currently name and stats (+iv, +evs))

Main settings are:
- `priorities`
- `colors`
- `draw`
- `search`

It has many options which i won't specify because i've made it for myself and i've no idea if anyone will ever find this repo
